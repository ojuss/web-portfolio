  Implementing DKIM signing for sending emails with Mailchannels and Cloudflare
  Workers

Mailchannels
[allows free email sending](https://blog.mailchannels.com/mailchannels-enables-free-email-sending-for-cloudflare-workers-customers)
using a Cloudflare Worker.
[I wrote some code](https://github.com/maggie-j-liu/mail) to adapt the example
provided in the article to implement DKIM signing.

The documentation for email sending with Mailchannels can be found
[here](https://api.mailchannels.net/tx/v1/documentation), for further
customization.

## Setup

Before you start, make sure to set up Wrangler as explained
[here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/).

We'll need to generate keys and a DNS record, which we can do with the steps in
[this tutorial](https://www.mailhardener.com/kb/how-to-create-a-dkim-record-with-openssl).

### Generate the Private Key

To generate a private key and upload it to the worker, run the following
command:

```sh linenums=false
openssl genrsa 2048 | tee priv_key.pem | openssl rsa -outform der | openssl base64 -A | wrangler secret put DKIM_PRIVATE_KEY
```

The parts of this command:

`openssl genrsa 2048` generates a 2048-bit RSA key. The output is passed to

`tee priv_key.pem`, which writes the key to the `priv_key.pem` file, and passes
the key to

`openssl rsa -outform der | openssl base 64 -A`, which converts the key from PEM
format to DER format, then base64 encodes it (this essentially removes the
header from the PEM formatted key). The output is finally passed to

`wrangler secret put DKIM_PRIVATE_KEY`, which adds it as a secret to our
Cloudflare Worker.

### Create the DNS Record

Now, we need to add the public key to a TXT record. Run the following command:

```sh linenums=false
echo -n "v=DKIM1;p=" > record.txt && openssl rsa -in priv_key.pem -pubout -outform der | openssl base64 -A >> record.txt
```

This creates a public key from the private key
(`openssl rsa -in priv_key.pem -pubout -outform der`), encodes it in base64
(`openssl base 64 -A`), and finally writes it to the `record.txt` file.

Copy the contents of the `record.txt` file and add it as a `TXT` record to your
domain.

### Updating the Code

Find these lines in
[`src/index.ts`](https://github.com/maggie-j-liu/mail/blob/main/src/index.ts):

```ts
            to: [
              {
                email: "", // add your to email here
              },
            ],
```

```ts
            dkim_domain: "", // add your domain
```

```ts
        from: {
          email: "", // add your from email here
        },
```

and add in your `to` and `from` email addresses, as well as the domain you are
sending from.

## Running

Run `wrangler dev` or `wrangler publish`, and you should be able to test it out!
