This is my solution to
[Superbull](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=531). We need
to find the maximum spanning tree of the graph formed by the teams, where the
weight of an edge between two teams is the points scored if the two teams play
against each other.

## Solution 1 - Kruskal's

We can use Kruskal's to find the maximum spanning tree of the graph, which
requires finding all the edges and sorting them in decreasing order of edge
weight. Connecting two vertices of the graph will eliminate $1$ team, and we can
stop after we have eliminated $n - 1$ teams.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log{N})$

## Solution 2 - Prim's

Since the graph is dense, it is faster to use $N^2$ Prim's. For each of the $n$
iterations, we find the farthest unselected node from the current spanning tree
and add it to the graph. Then, we update the distances of all the other nodes
accordingly.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$
